# DartScoreKeeper
Keeping Score of Dart Games

## About this Project

### This is a simple project I began recently in order to show a friend the basics of html, css, and javascript (vanilla)
### He was interested in making a simple scoring calculator that could be used when playing darts.

#### We may work together to increase functionality and respsonsiveness so the application can be better used on a tablet, however this hinges on his continued interest in learning programming basics.
